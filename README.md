# Semantic Enrichment Framework

In this repository, we present the results achieved by the Semantic Enrichment Framework for Event Classification in tweets, proposed in the paper "Improving the Classification of Events in Tweets using Semantic Enrichment", submitted to the 14th ESWC 2017.

We present the results of the experiments performed using two versions of the proposed framework:
- in the file initial-version, we present the results regarding the experiments using a prior version of the proposed framework. More details about the experiments performed can be found in http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7817101/.

- in the file eswc-version, we present the results of the current version of the proposed framework, which includes the external enrichment approach and the semantic feature pruning algorithm, as well as a comparison to the word embeddings approach to evaluate the results achieved.
