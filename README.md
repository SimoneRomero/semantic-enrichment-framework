# Semantic Enrichment Framework

In this repository, we present the results achieved by the Semantic Enrichment Framework for Event Classification in tweets.

We present the results of the experiments performed using the proposed framework:
- details about the initial version of the proposed framework, as well as about the experiments performed, and the results achieved can be found in the paper "Experiments with Semantic Enrichment for Event Classification in Tweets", available in http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7817101/.

- in the file word_embeddings_results, we present the results of the current version of the proposed framework, which includes the external enrichment approach and the semantic feature pruning algorithm, as well as a comparison to the word embeddings approach to evaluate the results achieved.
